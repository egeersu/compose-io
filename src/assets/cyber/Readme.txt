Hello, this is Square! Thank you for downloading this mini set.

This character is part of a series of cyberpunk assets.
There will be 10 or 30 sets in total.
Various topics like:
Characters, enemies, bosses, npc
vehicles of different types
levels and tilesets
objects of the environment and interior
music and sounds
visual effects
and much more:)
Many of them will include all the sources (I mean absolutely everything sources!) To create a variety of content. And also different variations of one object.
Every purchase is important to me, but more important is the ability to uniquely use the asset you purchased. Therefore, i will try to release the most detailed and customizable sets (where the size of the set and my free time allow). So that you can adjust them to your vision of the future or current project.
Free kits are deliberately made less unique, although you can make something interesting out of them :)
In the paid kits, as i said above, there will be more variety and creative possibilities.

To be honest, i was very inspired by the game that the guys from (CD) Project Red have developed!
I really love Cyberpunk worlds(Megazone is probably my favorite), and i hope you will too!

If you have any questions, suggestions and ideas, send  messages and comments!
Also, if you liked a free bundle, you can support me with a small amount so that free bundles appear more often.

P.S. If you've ever used my kits in your projects, i would like to see them, because i have never met my work anywhere else :(
Very interesting to see! I look forward to your feedback on successes or work in progress.
Thank you, take care of yourself!
P.S. 2. Sorry for my terrible English, I am writing via google translator :)
