## Abstract

[Compose.io](https://compose-io.netlify.app/) is a customizable browser game designed for large-scale behavioral data collection on symbolic rule learning and generalization. Each level in the game consists of a survival phase where the player has to gather and use items to stay alive, and a crafting phase where items can be combined to produce stronger items. By setting their own custom crafting rules, researchers can study how humans learn the underlying rule system through trial and error. By chaining custom levels with different rulesets one after another, researchers can also study how humans generalize from one rule system to another.

## 1. Introduction

1. Symbolic rule learning. Trial and error as opposed to symbolic translation on a fixed training/test dataset. 


2. Games allow us to 
    - Study rule learning over time, through trial and error. By interacting with a complex environment. (Cite developmental literature)
    - Entertainment as a natural incentive. Collect data for free. (How to justify?)

### Groups

| Group   |      Training      |  Testing |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 1 |  Permissible | Permissible |
| 2 |    Strict   |   Strict |
| 3 | Permissible |    Strict |
| 4 |  Strict | Permissible |

### Hypothesis 1

> Exposure to a strict system prior to a flexible system causes participants to be more conservative when learning the new system. 



### Hypothesis 2
> Exposure to a flexible system prior to a strict system will cause participants to have a higher failure rate during testing.
